# V2 SDK Integration into the rosa CLI

**Last Updated Date**: 2026-07-18

## Summary

This document explores how the `rosa` CLI can support **both** the v1 SDK
(`ocm-sdk-go`, against the OCM API) and the v2 SDK (`hyperfleet-sdk-go`, against
the HyperFleet Platform API) side by side, with v1 remaining the default and v2
selected per-invocation via a flag. It is a companion to
[v2-sdk-initiative.md](v2-sdk-initiative.md), which covers the SDK itself; this
doc covers the **consumer integration** (Story 3 of that initiative).

Two findings from the rosa codebase drive the design:

1. The v1 SDK's generated types (`cmv1.Cluster` and friends) are the CLI's
   de-facto internal domain model, referenced by **~151 non-test files** — the
   SDK cannot simply be swapped underneath the CLI.
2. The HCP lifecycle commands call the OCM API far beyond CRUD — versions,
   regions, machine types, billing accounts, quota, subscriptions. The
   Platform API's *initial* surface (Cluster + NodePool) backs almost none of
   these, and even as it reaches feature parity over time, those features
   return **re-based on AWS-account tenancy** instead of the OCM org. The v2
   flow is therefore a genuinely different flow — initially smaller, and
   permanently forked wherever identity is consulted — not the same flow with
   a swapped transport.

The recommended approach is **command-level routing**: each HCP lifecycle
command dispatches at the top of its `run` function to either the existing
v1 path (untouched) or a v2-native path that talks `v1alpha1` types directly to
the v2 SDK. Output formatting is kept identical by reusing the existing
`cmv1`-based printers through a small, **display-only `v1alpha1 → cmv1`
mapper**.

## Current rosa CLI Architecture (relevant to integration)

### 1. Clean input seam, leaky output seam

Commands build rosa's own domain struct — `ocm.Spec` (`pkg/ocm/clusters.go:64`),
**not** an SDK type — and hand it to the OCM client:

```go
// cmd/create/cluster/cmd.go:3480
clusterConfig := ocm.Spec{ ... }
// cmd/create/cluster/cmd.go:3672
cluster, err := r.OCMClient.CreateCluster(clusterConfig)   // returns *cmv1.Cluster
```

The `Spec → cmv1 → HTTP` translation is hidden inside `pkg/ocm`
(`createClusterSpec`). On the way out, however, the return type is
`*cmv1.Cluster`, and that type is consumed directly throughout the CLI:

- **~151 non-test files** across `cmd/` and `pkg/` reference
  `github.com/openshift-online/ocm-sdk-go/clustersmgmt/v1` types directly
  (describe, output formatting, validation, machinepool, ingress, idp,
  autoscaler, …).
- `pkg/rosa.Runtime` itself embeds `Cluster *cmv1.Cluster`, and
  `Runtime.FetchCluster()` returns `*cmv1.Cluster` (`pkg/rosa/runtime.go`).

`cmv1.Cluster` is not just an SDK response type — it is the CLI's internal
cluster model.

### 2. Lifecycle commands depend on OCM far beyond CRUD

Measured by distinct `OCMClient` method calls:

| Code path | Distinct OCM calls | Examples beyond CRUD |
|---|---|---|
| `cmd/create/cluster/cmd.go` | ~16 | `GetRegionList`, `ValidateVersion`, `GetAvailableMachineTypesInRegion`, `GetBillingAccounts`, `GetCredRequests`, `EnsureNoPendingClusters` (quota), `IsTechnologyPreview`, `GetOidcConfig` |
| `cmd/describe/cluster/cmd.go` | ~11 | `GetSubscriptionBySubscriptionID`, `GetLimitedSupportReasons`, `GetInflightChecks`, `FetchClusterMigrations`, `GetScheduledUpgrade` |
| `pkg/machinepool` | ~19 | `GetDefaultClusterFlavors`, `ListKubeletConfigNames`, `GetTuningConfigsName`, `GetClusterAutoscaler` |

The HyperFleet Platform API's initial surface is **Cluster + NodePool only**
(see [v2-sdk-initiative.md](v2-sdk-initiative.md)). Today there is nothing to
back versions, regions, machine types, billing, subscriptions, or quota. Any
design premised on "same command code, different backend" hits this wall: those
calls either fail at runtime, require keeping a live OCM connection alongside
HyperFleet (defeating the migration), or must be skipped — and "skip this step"
is a change to the command flow, not to the transport.

Most of these features are expected to reach the Platform API eventually —
re-based on AWS-account tenancy rather than the OCM org. That changes the
timeline, not the design conclusion; see
[Does future v2 feature parity change the recommendation?](#does-future-v2-feature-parity-change-the-recommendation)

### 3. The Runtime is the wiring choke point

Commands are wrapped by `rosa.DefaultRunner(RuntimeWithOCM(), runFn)` and reach
the SDK through `r.OCMClient.*` and `r.FetchCluster()` (`pkg/rosa/runner.go`,
`pkg/rosa/runtime.go`). Backend selection and client construction belong here.

### 4. Auth models diverge

| | v1 (OCM) | v2 (HyperFleet) |
|---|---|---|
| Credential | OCM SSO tokens (`rosa login`, `config.Load()`) | AWS IAM (SigV4) |
| Endpoint | Global `api.openshift.com` | Per-region Platform API endpoint |
| Runtime support today | `WithOCM()` | needs AWS creds (`WithAWS()` exists) + endpoint resolution |

`--hyperfleet` mode cannot reuse the login config; it needs AWS credentials
(the Runtime already obtains these via `WithAWS()`) plus regional endpoint
resolution. Notably, in v2 mode **no OCM login should be required at all**.

## Recommended Approach: Command-Level Routing + Display-Only Mapper

Dispatch at the top of each HCP lifecycle command, not inside the client:

```
rosa create cluster --hosted-cp [--hyperfleet]
  run()
   ├── default:      existing run path (untouched — all OCM calls intact)
   └── --hyperfleet: runHyperFleet()
                      · flags → v1alpha1.Cluster (struct literal)
                      · v2 SDK client-go-style verbs, natively
                      · no OCM connection; OCM-only steps skipped by design
                      · output via existing printers, fed by a display-only
                        v1alpha1 → cmv1 mapper
```

### Design elements

1. **Persistent `--hyperfleet` flag** (final name TBD), registered globally.
   Each HCP lifecycle command that supports v2 checks it first thing in `run`
   and dispatches to its v2-native implementation. Commands without a v2 path
   fail fast with a clear error when the flag is set — no silent fallthrough
   to v1.

2. **Same cobra commands, same flag definitions.** Flags are registered once on
   the command, so "preserve all CLI flags" holds structurally. The v2 path
   reads the same flag values. Flags that v2 cannot honor (billing account,
   OCM-specific properties, …) are **rejected with an explicit error**, not
   silently ignored.

3. **v2-native run functions** live alongside the v1 code (e.g.
   `cmd/create/cluster/hyperfleet.go`, or a shared `pkg/hyperfleet/`). They
   build `v1alpha1.Cluster` / `v1alpha1.NodePool` struct literals from flags
   and call the v2 SDK's client-go-style verbs directly — exactly the
   consumption model the initiative doc intends for v2 consumers. No
   `ocm.Spec`, no builders.

4. **`Runtime.WithHyperFleet()`** constructs the v2 SDK client: AWS SigV4 creds
   via the existing `WithAWS()` machinery, plus regional endpoint resolution.
   It does **not** call `WithOCM()` — v2 mode must work without `rosa login`.

5. **Display-only `v1alpha1 → cmv1` mapper.** The describe/list output code is
   large, `cmv1`-typed rendering logic (`formatClusterHypershift`,
   `clusterInfraConfig`, … in `cmd/describe/cluster/cmd.go`). Rather than
   reimplementing it (output drift risk) or refactoring it (151-file blast
   radius), the v2 path maps `v1alpha1.Cluster → cmv1.Cluster` **only for
   display**, populating only fields the printers read. `cmv1` types are
   constructible via builders (`cmv1.NewCluster().ID(...).Build()`), so this is
   mechanical. Fields with no HyperFleet equivalent *yet* (subscription,
   limited support, billing) render as absent; the mapper grows alongside the
   Platform API surface and the commands wired to it.

### Commands in scope (per acceptance criteria)

| Command | v2 path |
|---|---|
| `rosa create cluster --hosted-cp` | flags → `v1alpha1.Cluster` → `Clusters().Create()` |
| `rosa describe cluster` | `Clusters().Get()` → display mapper → existing printer |
| `rosa edit cluster` | `Clusters().Patch()` / `Update()` |
| `rosa delete cluster` | `Clusters().Delete()` |
| `rosa create/list/describe/edit/delete machinepool` (HCP) | `Clusters().NodePools(...)` verbs |
| `rosa logs`, log forwarders | TBD — depends on Platform API logs surface (initiative Open Question 4) |

Everything else (`idp`, `ingress`, `addons`, roles, upgrades, …) has no v2
path and errors fast under `--hyperfleet`.

## Alternative Considered: Swapped Backend Behind a Narrow Interface

An earlier draft of this document recommended extracting a narrow
`ClusterBackend` interface (cluster + node pool CRUD), selecting the
implementation on the flag, and having the v2 implementation map
`v1alpha1 ↔ cmv1` in both directions so all command code ran unchanged.

**Why it was rejected** — the premise "command code unchanged" is false:

- The lifecycle commands make **dozens of OCM calls beyond CRUD** (see table
  above) that have no HyperFleet equivalent. Under `--hyperfleet` with no OCM
  login these calls cannot succeed. The options are all bad: widen the
  interface to ~40 methods that mostly map to nothing; keep a dual
  OCM+HyperFleet connection (defeats the migration and still requires OCM
  SSO); or riddle the shared code with `if hyperfleet { skip }` branches —
  which is command-level routing, just smeared through the code instead of
  cleanly separated.
- It required a **bidirectional** mapper (`ocm.Spec → v1alpha1` on requests,
  `v1alpha1 → cmv1` on responses) with fidelity high enough for validation
  logic, not just display. The recommended approach keeps only the smaller,
  display-only half.
- Even at feature parity, the flows fork wherever identity is consulted. Most
  v1 features (billing account selection, versions, IdPs, …) are expected to
  return in the Platform API — re-based on **AWS-account tenancy** instead of
  the OCM org (some, like the OCM quota precheck, will not). The *step*
  "select a billing account" exists in both flows, but the data source,
  credentials, and failure modes differ. Shared command code would need
  identity-conditional branches at every such point — which is command-level
  routing, just smeared through shared functions instead of cleanly split.

Two other alternatives were rejected earlier and remain rejected:

- **Refactor the ~151 files onto a neutral domain model** — a big-bang rewrite
  contradicting "v1 remains the default, side by side."
- **OCM-compatible facade on the Platform API** (server-side shim so the v1 SDK
  talks to HyperFleet) — explicitly dropped from the initiative.

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Output drift between v1 and v2 paths | Reuse v1 printers via the display mapper; acceptance e2e tests (`hcp_cluster_test.go`, `hcp_machine_pool_test.go`) are the contract |
| Duplicated command-flow logic | The duplicated part is precisely what *must* differ (validation backed by endpoints that don't exist in v2); keep v2 run functions thin and share flag parsing/printing |
| Interactive mode in v2 (`--interactive` prompts source region/version/machine-type lists from OCM) | Phase 1: disable interactive under `--hyperfleet`; later source lists from AWS APIs or Platform API when available |
| Flag surface ambiguity (~300 create-cluster flags, many meaningless in v2) | Explicit allowlist per v2 command; anything else errors with "not supported with --hyperfleet" |
| Display mapper completeness | Populate only fields the printers read for the acceptance-test commands; grow test-by-test |

## Relationship to the "migrate directly to client-go" vision

This approach *is* the direct migration, scoped: the v2 run functions consume
the v2 SDK natively (`v1alpha1` struct literals + verb methods), exactly as the
initiative doc intends. Only the presentation layer borrows v1's printers via
the display mapper — a bounded concession to "identical output formats" that
can be retired if/when the v1 path is removed. The v2-native command logic is
also essentially what `rosactl` needs, so it is a candidate for sharing between
the two CLIs (see Open Question 3).

## Open Questions

1. **Endpoint resolution in v2 mode** — a new flag (`--hyperfleet-url`), a
   region→endpoint map baked into the CLI, or discovery?
2. **Which region?** v1 infers/validates region via OCM; v2 mode must derive it
   from `--region` / AWS config, and it also selects the Platform API endpoint.
3. **rosa vs. rosactl** — retrofit `rosa` (this doc) or treat greenfield
   `rosactl` as the real v2 home, sharing the v2-native command logic? The
   command-level-routing approach keeps this optionality open.
4. **Type divergence** — how far do `v1alpha1.Cluster` / `NodePool` diverge
   from the `cmv1` fields the printers read? This sizes the display mapper
   (see also Open Question 3 in the initiative doc).
5. **Waiting/status UX** — v1 create supports `--watch`-style polling via OCM;
   what does the v2 path poll (`Status` conditions on the CRD-shaped resource)?

## Suggested First Steps

1. Add the persistent `--hyperfleet` flag and `Runtime.WithHyperFleet()`
   (AWS creds + endpoint config + v2 SDK client). No command wired yet.
2. Wire `rosa create cluster --hosted-cp --hyperfleet`: minimal flag allowlist
   → `v1alpha1.Cluster` literal → `Clusters().Create()`. Print via a first-cut
   display mapper.
3. Wire `describe` / `delete` cluster, then the machinepool verbs.
4. Run `hcp_cluster_test.go` / `hcp_machine_pool_test.go` against
   `--hyperfleet`; expand the flag allowlist and display mapper until they
   pass.
